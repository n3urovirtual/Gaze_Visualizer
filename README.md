 This project helps you produce graphs that are commonly used in eye movement studies, such as **fixation maps**, **scanpaths**, and **heatmaps**. The project was
made with the GazePoint (GP3/GP3 HD) eye-tracker in mind, but it can be easily used with eye-tracking data recorded by other eye-trackers. 

## 1) Fixation Map
Circles represent fixation points and circles' diameter are proportional to fixation durations (i.e., the longer the fixation, the larger the circle). This type of visualization is used to understand where a user/participant looked at and for how long.

## 2) Scanpath
Sequences of fixations are connected with lines, thus providing information about the trajectories (paths) of the eyes when scanning the visual field. This type of visualization is used to understand the time-course of gaze behavior, i.e., what information was looked at first, second etc. as well as to provide valuable insight into the visual scanning pattern adopted by the user/participant. 

## 3) Heatmap
Duration-based heatmaps effectively reveal the focus of visual attention, by showing how gaze behavior is clustered or varies over space. Parts covered by cold colors (e.g., blue or cyan) are less fixated than parts covered by warmer colors (e.g., red). In that sense, parts covered by warm colors show where users/participants directed their attention the most (i.e., the most attention-grabbing locations).
