 This project helps you produce graphs that are commonly used in studies recording eye movements (e.g., in scene perception), such as **fixation maps**, **scanpaths**, and **heatmaps**. The project was made with the GazePoint (GP3/GP3 HD) eye-tracker in mind, but it can be easily used with eye-tracking data recorded by other eye-trackers. 

## 1) Fixation Map
Fixations are overlaid on top of an image using circles and the diameter of the circle reflects the duration of the fixation, such that longer the fixation, the larger the circle. Fixation maps are typically used to visualize where a person looked at while viewing a particular image and for how long.

## 2) Scanpath
Sequences of fixations are connected with lines, thus providing information about the trajectories (paths) of the eyes when scanning the visual field. This type of visualization is used to understand the time-course of gaze behavior, i.e., what information was looked at first, second etc. as well as to provide valuable insight into the visual scanning pattern adopted by the user/participant.

## 3) Heatmap
Heatmaps effectively reveal the focus of visual attention, by showing how gaze behavior is clustered or varies over space. Parts covered by cold colors (e.g., blue or cyan) are less fixated than parts covered by warmer colors (e.g., red). In that sense, parts covered by warm colors show where users/participants directed their attention the most (i.e., the most attention-grabbing locations).
