# Gazepoint_Visualizer
 This project helps you visualize eye-tracking data which have been recorded with the Gazepoint GP3-HD (or GP3) eye-tracker. 

Examples of the visualizations you can create include: 1) **fixation maps**, 2) **scanpaths**, and 3) **heatmaps**.

## 1) Fixation Map
Circles represent fixation points and circles' diameter are proportional to fixations' duration (e.g., the longer the fixation, the larger the circle). This type of visualization is used to understand where a participant looked at and for how long.

## 2) Scanpath
Fixations are numbered and connected with lines. This type of visualization is used to understand the time-course of looking behavior, i.e., where the participant looked at first, second etc. 

## 3) Heatmap
Duration-based heatmaps effectively reveal the focus of visual attention, by showing how looking is distributed over a stimulus. Parts covered by cold colors (e.g., blue or cyan) are less fixated than parts covered by warmer colors (e.g., red). In that sense, parts covered by warm colors show where participants directed their attention the most.
